/**
 * A Handler allows you to send and process {Message} and Runnable objects
 * associated with a thread's {Looper}.  Each Handler instance is associated
 * with a single thread and that thread's looper.  When you create a new
 * Handler, it is bound to the thread / looper of the thread that  is creating
 * it -- from that point on, it will deliver messages and runnables to that
 * message queue and execute them as they come out of the message queue.
 *
 * There are two main uses for a Handler: (1) to schedule messages and
 * runnables to be executed as some point in the future; and (2) to enqueue
 * an action to be performed on a different thread than your own.
 *
 * When posting or sending to a Handler, you can either allow the item to be
 * processed as soon as the message queue is ready to do so, or specify a
 * delay before it gets processed or absolute time for it to be processed.
 * The latter two allow you to implement timeouts,ticks, and other
 * timing-based behavior.
 *
 * When a process is created for your application, its main thread is
 * dedicated to running a message queue that takes care of managing the
 * top-level application objects (activities, broadcast receivers, etc) and
 * any windows they create.  You can create your own threads, and communicate
 * back with the main application thread through a Handler.  This is done by
 * calling the same {postMessage()} methods as before, but from your new
 * thread.  The given Runnable or Message will then be scheduled in the
 * Handler's message queue and processed when appropriate.
