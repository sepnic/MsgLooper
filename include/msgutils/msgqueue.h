/*
 * Queue sets provide a mechanism to allow a task to block (pend) on a read
 * operation from multiple queues or simultaneously.
 *
 * See https://www.freertos.org/xQueueCreateSet.html for an example using this
 * function.
 *
 * A queue set must be explicitly created using a call to mqueueset_create()
 * before it can be used.  Once created, standard FreeRTOS queues can be added
 * to the set using calls to mqueueset_add_queue().
 * mqueueset_select_queue() is used to determine which, if any of the queues
 * contained in the set is in a state where a queue read operation would be
 * successful.
 *
 * Note 1:  See the documentation on https://wwwFreeRTOS.org/RTOS-queue-sets.html
 * for reasons why queue sets are very rarely needed in practice as there are
 * simpler methods of blocking on multiple objects.
 *
 * Note 2:  A receive (in the case of a queue) operation must not be performed
 * on a member of a queue set unless a call to mqueueset_select_queue() has first
 * returned a handle to that set member.
 *
 * Note 3:  @msg_count specifies the maximum number of events that can be queued
 * at once. To be absolutely certain that events are not lost @msg_count should
 * be set to the total sum of the length of the queues added to the set.
 *
 * Note 4:  If the queue could not be successfully added to the queue set because
 * it is already a member of a different queue set.
 *
 * Note 5:  If the queue could not be successfully remove from the queue set
 * because it is not in the queue set, or the queue is not empty.
 *
 * Usage example:
 *
 * // Create the queues that will be contained in the set.
 * queue1 = mqueue_create(ITEM_SIZE_QUEUE_1, QUEUE_LENGTH_1);
 * queue2 = mqueue_create(ITEM_SIZE_QUEUE_2, QUEUE_LENGTH_2);
 *
 * // Create the queue set large enough to hold an event for every space
 * // in every queue that is to be added to the set.
 * queueset = mqueueset_create(QUEUE_LENGTH_1 + QUEUE_LENGTH_2);
 *
 * // Add the queues to the set. Reading from these queues can only be
 * // performed after a call to mqueueset_select_queue() has returned the queue
 * // handle.
 * mqueueset_add_queue(queueset, queue1);
 * mqueueset_add_queue(queueset, queue2);
 *
 * for ( ;; ) {
 *     // Block to wait for something to be available from the queues that
 *     // have been added to the set. Don't block longer than 200ms.
 *     activemember = mqueueset_select_queue(queueset, 200);
 *
 *     if (activemember == queue1) {
 *         mqueue_receive(activemember, &queue1_msg, 0);
 *         // todo: process queue1_msg
 *     }
 *     else if(activemember == queue2) {
 *         mqueue_receive(activemember, &queue2_msg, 0);
 *         // todo: process queue2_msg
 *     }
 *     else {
 *         // The 200ms block time expired without an queue being ready.
 *     }
 * }
 *
